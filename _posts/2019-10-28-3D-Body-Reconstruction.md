![result](/images/20191028_3D_body_4.gif "result") <br>
This video shows how I reconstruct the 3D skeleton pose, the body shape and the texture of myself based on the video from a single camera. We are still working on it to better simulate the face, hand and foot.
details are comming soon... <br>
I'm seeking a 2020 summer internship position in AR/VR. Please let me know if you are interested in my research. My email is me[at]qzane.com
